This app is a fitness tracker that allows users to view, create, and track daily workouts. It allows the user to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It also tracks the name, type of exercise, weight, reps, sets, and duration of exercise. For cardio exercises the distance traveled is tracked.

Given front end starter code, we are tasked to create a database using MongoDB, create Mongoose schema, and handle routes with Express.
