This app is a fitness tracker that allows users to view, create, and track daily workouts. It allows the user to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It also tracks the name, type of exercise, weight, reps, sets, and duration of exercise. For cardio exercises the distance traveled is tracked.
